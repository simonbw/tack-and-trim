## Titan

I'm still toying with the idea of setting this game on Titan, the moon of Saturn.

General

- Titan is a tidally-locked moon of saturn
- Gravity is about 0.14 g
- Titan day is ~16 earth days

Surface

- "Land" is mostly very cold refular water ice
- It has varied geography: mountains, canyons, plains, rolling dunes
- Has seas of liquid methane/ethane covering about 1% of surface area, mostly around the poles
- Has Thaulins which are weird blackish tar like hydrocarbons that probably wash up on shore

Atmosphere

- Mostly nitrogen (95%) and methane (5%)
- Atmospheric super-rotation
  - Everywhere has a prevailing eastward wind
  - Winds get really intense as you increase altitude
- Has storms and rain similar to Earth

Cryovolcanism

- Volcanoes of liquid and gasseous methane
-

A little bit of fantasy:

- Titan is experiencing unusually high cryovolcanic activity, leading to more methane on the surface, which means seas rise
- This has caused a bit of warming, which has also increased sea levels
- Overall seas rise to cover more like 15% of the surface, and they are now connected enough
