### Core Concepts

| Concept             | Description                                                                   |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **World**           | The simulation container. Call `world.step(dt)` each frame.                   |
| **Body**            | A rigid body with position, angle, and velocity. Contains one or more shapes. |
| **Shape**           | Collision geometry attached to a body (Circle, Box, Convex, etc.)             |
| **Constraint**      | Maintains a relationship between two bodies (distance, hinge, rigid lock)     |
| **Spring**          | Applies forces to maintain a relationship (softer than constraints)           |
| **Material**        | Identifier for collision properties                                           |
| **ContactMaterial** | Defines friction/restitution between two materials                            |

## Body Types

### DynamicBody

Bodies that respond to forces and collisions. Most game objects use this.

```typescript
import DynamicBody from "core/physics/body/DynamicBody";
import Circle from "core/physics/shapes/Circle";

const ball = new DynamicBody({
  mass: 1,
  position: [0, 10],
  velocity: [5, 0],
  damping: 0.1, // Linear velocity damping
  angularDamping: 0.1, // Angular velocity damping
});
ball.addShape(new Circle({ radius: 0.5 }));
world.bodies.add(ball);
```

Key properties:

- `mass` — Total mass (affects acceleration from forces)
- `velocity` — Current linear velocity
- `angularVelocity` — Current rotation speed
- `damping` / `angularDamping` — Velocity decay per second
- `fixedRotation` — Prevent rotation
- `fixedX` / `fixedY` — Constrain to axis

### StaticBody

Immovable bodies with infinite mass. Use for terrain, walls, and boundaries.

```typescript
import StaticBody from "core/physics/body/StaticBody";
import Box from "core/physics/shapes/Box";

const ground = new StaticBody({ position: [0, -1] });
ground.addShape(new Box({ width: 100, height: 2 }));
world.bodies.add(ground);
```

Static bodies:

- Never move (velocity is always zero)
- Don't respond to forces or impulses
- Very efficient (excluded from most calculations)

### KinematicBody

Bodies with scripted motion. They move but aren't affected by collisions.

```typescript
import KinematicBody from "core/physics/body/KinematicBody";

const platform = new KinematicBody({ position: [0, 5] });
platform.addShape(new Box({ width: 4, height: 0.5 }));
world.bodies.add(platform);

// In your game loop:
platform.velocity.set(2, 0); // Move right at 2 units/sec
```

Kinematic bodies:

- Set velocity directly (not computed from forces)
- Push dynamic bodies but aren't pushed back
- Good for moving platforms, elevators, crushers

## Shapes

Shapes define collision geometry. Each body can have multiple shapes.

| Shape         | Description                 | Key Properties               |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `Circle`      | Circular collider           | `radius`                     |
| `Box`         | Axis-aligned rectangle      | `width`, `height`            |
| `Convex`      | Arbitrary convex polygon    | `vertices` (array of points) |
| `Capsule`     | Rectangle with rounded ends | `length`, `radius`           |
| `Line`        | Line segment                | `length`                     |
| `Plane`       | Infinite plane              | `normal` direction           |
| `Particle`    | Point collider              | (no size)                    |
| `Heightfield` | Terrain data                | `heights`, `elementWidth`    |

### Shape Options

```typescript
new Circle({
  radius: 1,
  position: [0, 0.5], // Offset from body center
  angle: 0, // Local rotation
  collisionGroup: 0x0001, // What group this shape belongs to
  collisionMask: 0xffff, // What groups this shape collides with
  sensor: false, // If true, detects overlaps but doesn't collide
  material: myMaterial, // For friction/restitution lookup
});
```

### Collision Filtering

Use `collisionGroup` and `collisionMask` to control what collides:

```typescript
const PLAYER = 0x0001;
const ENEMY = 0x0002;
const BULLET = 0x0004;

// Player collides with enemies and bullets
playerShape.collisionGroup = PLAYER;
playerShape.collisionMask = ENEMY | BULLET;

// Enemy bullets don't hit enemies
enemyBulletShape.collisionGroup = BULLET;
enemyBulletShape.collisionMask = PLAYER; // Only hits player
```

## Constraints

Constraints maintain geometric relationships between bodies using iterative solving.

### DistanceConstraint

Maintains a fixed distance between two points.

```typescript
import DistanceConstraint from "core/physics/constraints/DistanceConstraint";

const rope = new DistanceConstraint(bodyA, bodyB, {
  distance: 5, // Target distance
  localAnchorA: [0, 0], // Attachment point on bodyA
  localAnchorB: [0, 0], // Attachment point on bodyB
  collideConnected: false, // Should connected bodies collide?
});
world.constraints.add(rope);
```

### RevoluteConstraint

A hinge/pivot joint allowing rotation around a point.

```typescript
import RevoluteConstraint from "core/physics/constraints/RevoluteConstraint";

const hinge = new RevoluteConstraint(bodyA, bodyB, {
  worldPivot: [5, 10], // Pivot point in world coordinates
  collideConnected: false,
});
world.constraints.add(hinge);
```

### LockConstraint

Rigidly locks two bodies together (no relative movement).

```typescript
import LockConstraint from "core/physics/constraints/LockConstraint";

const weld = new LockConstraint(bodyA, bodyB);
world.constraints.add(weld);
```

### Tuning Constraints

Constraints can be made softer using stiffness and relaxation:

```typescript
constraint.setStiffness(1000); // Lower = softer (default is very high)
constraint.setRelaxation(4); // Higher = more damping
```

## Springs

Springs apply forces rather than hard constraints, creating softer connections.

**Note:** Springs require `bodyA` to be a `DynamicBody` since forces are only applied to dynamic bodies. `bodyB` can be any body type.

### LinearSpring

Connects two points with a spring force.

```typescript
import LinearSpring from "core/physics/springs/LinearSpring";

const spring = new LinearSpring(dynamicBodyA, bodyB, {
  stiffness: 100, // Spring constant
  damping: 5, // Damping coefficient
  restLength: 2, // Natural length
  localAnchorA: [0, 0],
  localAnchorB: [0, 0],
});
world.addSpring(spring);
```

### Other Spring Types

| Spring                     | Description                                   |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `RotationalSpring`         | Applies torque to maintain relative angle     |
| `DampedRotationalSpring`   | Rotational spring with separate damping       |
| `RopeSpring`               | Only applies force when stretched (pull-only) |
| `AimSpring`                | Rotates body to face a target direction       |
| `RotationalSolenoidSpring` | Continuous spinning force                     |

## Materials

Materials define surface properties for collision response.

```typescript
import Material from "core/physics/material/Material";
import ContactMaterial from "core/physics/material/ContactMaterial";

const ice = new Material();
const rubber = new Material();

const iceOnRubber = new ContactMaterial(ice, rubber, {
  friction: 0.1, // Friction coefficient (0 = frictionless)
  restitution: 0.3, // Bounciness (0 = no bounce, 1 = perfect bounce)
  stiffness: 1e7, // Contact stiffness
  relaxation: 3, // Contact damping
  surfaceVelocity: 0, // For conveyor belts
});
world.contactMaterials.add(iceOnRubber);

// Assign materials to shapes
shape.material = ice;
```

## Events

The World emits events during simulation. Subscribe using the EventEmitter API.

```typescript
world.on("beginContact", (event) => {
  console.log("Contact started:", event.bodyA.id, event.bodyB.id);
  console.log("Shapes:", event.shapeA, event.shapeB);
  console.log("Contact points:", event.contactEquations);
});

world.on("endContact", (event) => {
  console.log("Contact ended:", event.bodyA.id, event.bodyB.id);
});

world.on("impact", (event) => {
  // First frame of contact (for sound effects, damage, etc.)
  const impulse = event.contactEquation.multiplier;
  console.log("Impact force:", impulse);
});
```

### Event Types

| Event                    | Description                                         |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `beginContact`           | Two shapes started overlapping                      |
| `endContact`             | Two shapes stopped overlapping                      |
| `impact`                 | First contact between shapes (with ContactEquation) |
| `preSolve`               | Before constraint solving (can modify equations)    |
| `postStep`               | After step completes                                |
| `addBody` / `removeBody` | Body added/removed from world                       |
| `sleep` / `wakeup`       | Body sleep state changed                            |

## Raycasting

Cast rays to find intersections with bodies.

```typescript
// Find closest hit
const hit = world.raycast([0, 0], [10, 0], {
  collisionMask: 0xffff, // What to hit
  skipBackfaces: true, // Ignore hits from inside shapes
  filter: (body, shape) => {
    // Custom filter function
    return body !== player;
  },
});

if (hit) {
  console.log("Hit:", hit.body, hit.shape);
  console.log("Point:", hit.point);
  console.log("Normal:", hit.normal);
  console.log("Distance:", hit.distance);
}

// Find all hits (sorted by distance)
const allHits = world.raycastAll([0, 0], [10, 0]);
```

## Simulation Pipeline

The `World.step(dt)` method runs 12 steps each frame:

1. **Apply forces** — Springs apply forces, damping reduces velocities
2. **Broadphase** — Spatial algorithm finds potentially colliding body pairs
3. **Narrowphase** — Detailed collision detection between shape pairs
4. **Overlap tracking** — Track which shapes are overlapping for events
5. **Contact equations** — Generate constraints to prevent penetration
6. **Friction equations** — Generate constraints for surface friction
7. **Wake-up handling** — Wake sleeping bodies hit by fast-moving objects
8. **Event emission** — Fire beginContact/endContact events
9. **Constraint solving** — Gauss-Seidel iterative solver
10. **Integration** — Update positions and velocities
11. **Impact events** — Fire impact events for first contacts
12. **Sleep updates** — Put idle bodies to sleep

## Advanced Features

### Body Sleeping

Bodies can sleep when idle to improve performance.

```typescript
// Enable sleeping globally
world.sleepMode = SleepMode.BODY_SLEEPING;
// or for island-based sleeping (more aggressive):
world.sleepMode = SleepMode.ISLAND_SLEEPING;
world.islandSplit = true;

// Configure per-body
dynamicBody.allowSleep = true;
dynamicBody.sleepSpeedLimit = 0.2; // Speed threshold
dynamicBody.sleepTimeLimit = 1; // Seconds idle before sleeping

// Manual control
body.sleep();
body.wakeUp();
```

### Continuous Collision Detection (CCD)

Prevent fast-moving bodies from tunneling through thin objects.

```typescript
const bullet = new DynamicBody({
  mass: 0.1,
  ccdSpeedThreshold: 100, // Enable CCD above this speed
  ccdIterations: 10, // Binary search iterations
});
```

### Island Splitting

Group connected bodies for more efficient solving and sleeping.

```typescript
world.islandSplit = true;
```

### Solver Configuration

Tune the constraint solver for stability vs. performance.

```typescript
const world = new World({
  solverConfig: {
    iterations: 10, // More = more stable, slower
    tolerance: 0.0001, // Convergence threshold
  },
});
```

## Integration with Game Engine

In the game engine, physics bodies are managed through entities:

```typescript
class Ball extends BaseEntity implements Entity {
  body = new DynamicBody({ mass: 1, position: [0, 10] });

  constructor() {
    super();
    this.body.addShape(new Circle({ radius: 0.5 }));
  }

  onRender() {
    // Sync sprite position with physics body
    this.sprite?.position.set(...this.body.position);
    this.sprite?.rotation = this.body.angle;
  }
}
```

When an entity with a `body` property is added to the game, the body is automatically added to the physics world. When the entity is destroyed, the body is automatically removed.

See the main [core README](../Readme.md) for more on entity-physics integration.
