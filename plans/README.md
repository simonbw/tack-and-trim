# Plans

This directory contains plans for larger code changes we'd like to make.

A plan should describe the current state of the codebase, how we'd like to make the change, and what we want the code to look like afterwards.
It should include files that we expect to change, and a description of if the work can be done in parallel per-file or not.
When creating a plan, you should clarify any open questions so that the plan is ready to be executed on.
