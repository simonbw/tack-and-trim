# Wind & Wave Physics Reference

## Overview

This document explains the real-world physics of wind and waves that we're modeling in Tack & Trim. Understanding these phenomena helps inform which effects matter for gameplay and how to approximate them computationally.

The goal is a sailing experience where the ocean feels alive and varied - where different locations have distinct character based on geography, and where weather creates meaningful tactical decisions.

## Part 1: Wind Physics

### 1.1 What Is Wind?

Wind is bulk air movement driven by pressure differentials in the atmosphere. For our purposes, we care about:

- **Prevailing wind**: The dominant wind direction and strength for a region/time
- **Local modifications**: How terrain affects wind near the surface
- **Temporal variation**: Gusts, shifts, and weather changes

### 1.2 How Terrain Affects Wind

#### Blocking (Wind Shadow)

Land masses block wind flow. The **lee side** (downwind side) of an island or landmass experiences significantly reduced wind.

```
Wind direction: →

        ████████
       ██      ██
      ██ Island ██
       ██      ██        ←── Wind shadow zone
        ████████             (reduced wind)
            ╲
             ╲
              ╲  Shadow extends 5-20x the obstacle height
               ╲ (depends on atmospheric stability)
```

Key factors:

- Shadow length depends on obstacle height and atmospheric stability
- Shadow isn't a hard cutoff - wind gradually recovers downwind
- Turbulence is elevated in the shadow zone (gusty, variable direction)

#### Acceleration (Venturi Effect / Gap Winds)

Wind accelerates when forced through constrictions:

```
Wind direction: →

    ████████████████████
                          ══════════►  Accelerated flow
    ████████████████████             (can be 1.5-2x base speed)
         Gap/Channel
```

This happens in:

- Narrow straits between islands
- Mountain passes
- Gaps between buildings (less relevant for our game)

The acceleration factor depends on the constriction ratio.

#### Deflection

Wind bends around large obstacles. A headland or peninsula causes wind to curve:

```
Wind direction: →
                    ↗
                  ↗
    ████████    ↗
   ██      ██ →
  ██ Point  ██
   ██      ██ →
    ████████    ↘
                  ↘
                    ↘
```

#### Turbulence

The lee side of obstacles generates **turbulence** - chaotic, rapidly varying wind:

- Vortices shed from edges
- Variable direction and speed
- Makes sailing unpredictable and difficult

Turbulence intensity scales with:

- Wind speed
- Obstacle size
- Distance downwind (decays over distance)

### 1.3 Wind Over Water: Fetch

**Fetch** is the distance wind has blown over open water. It determines how much energy the wind has transferred to the water surface.

```
         ←────── Fetch = 500m ──────→

    █████                                Wind direction: →
    █████
    █████
    █████ Land    [Short fetch zone]     [Long fetch zone]
    █████          Small waves            Larger waves
    █████
    █████
```

Short fetch = less developed waves (smaller, steeper, more chaotic)
Long fetch = more developed waves (larger, rounder, more organized)

### 1.4 Temporal Variation

Wind changes over multiple timescales:

| Timescale | Phenomenon       | Cause                     |
| --------- | ---------------- | ------------------------- |
| Seconds   | Gusts            | Turbulent eddies          |
| Minutes   | Lulls and puffs  | Larger atmospheric mixing |
| Hours     | Wind shifts      | Weather system movement   |
| Days      | Weather patterns | Fronts, pressure systems  |

For gameplay, the most important are:

- **Gusts**: Brief increases in wind speed (seconds)
- **Shifts**: Changes in wind direction (minutes to hours)
- **Weather changes**: Major changes in conditions (hours)

---

## Part 2: Wave Physics

### 2.1 Types of Ocean Waves

#### Wind Waves (Sea)

Generated by **local wind** blowing over the water surface.

Characteristics:

- Chaotic, irregular
- Short wavelength (1-10 meters typically)
- Steep (high height-to-length ratio)
- Direction roughly matches wind direction
- Multiple frequencies superimposed

Development depends on:

- **Wind speed**: Faster wind = more energy = bigger waves
- **Fetch**: Longer fetch = more developed sea state
- **Duration**: How long wind has been blowing

#### Swell

Waves that have **traveled far from their generation area**.

Characteristics:

- Organized, regular
- Long wavelength (50-500+ meters)
- Gentle (low height-to-length ratio)
- Can travel thousands of kilometers
- Direction independent of local wind
- Arrives as distinct "sets" with consistent period

A calm day can have large swell from a distant storm.

#### The Difference Matters

```
Wind Waves (Local)              Swell (Distant)

  /\    /\  /\                    ___/‾‾‾\___/‾‾‾\___
 /  \  /  \/  \                  /           \
/    \/                         /             \

Short, steep, chaotic           Long, gentle, organized
Follows local wind              Any direction
```

In practice, the sea surface is usually a **combination** of wind waves and swell superimposed.

### 2.2 Wave Spectrum

Real ocean waves aren't single sinusoids - they're a sum of many wave components with different:

- Frequencies (wavelengths)
- Amplitudes
- Directions
- Phases

This is described by a **wave spectrum** - energy distribution across frequencies.

Common spectral models:

**Pierson-Moskowitz** (fully developed sea):

```
S(ω) = (αg²/ω⁵) × exp(-β(ω₀/ω)⁴)

where:
  ω = wave frequency
  ω₀ = peak frequency (depends on wind speed)
  α, β = constants
  g = gravity
```

**JONSWAP** (fetch-limited):
Adds a peak enhancement factor for developing seas.

For our game, we don't need to implement these exactly - just understand that:

1. Wave energy is distributed across frequencies
2. Peak frequency shifts lower (longer waves) with more fetch
3. Total energy increases with wind speed and fetch

### 2.3 How Terrain Affects Waves

#### Blocking

Land masses completely stop waves. Points in the **wave shadow** of an island receive no direct waves from that direction.

```
Swell direction: →

        ████████
       ██      ██
      ██ Island ██
       ██      ██          Wave shadow
        ████████          (no direct swell)
            ╲
             ╲
              ╲
               ╲
```

This is similar to wind blocking but more complete - waves don't "blow over" land.

#### Diffraction

Waves **bend around obstacles** and spread into shadowed regions. This is the key phenomenon for realistic coastal waters.

```
Swell direction: →

                    ↗ ↗ ↗
                  ↗
        ████████ → →
       ██      ██ → → → →
      ██ Island ██ → → → → → →
       ██      ██ → → → →
        ████████ → →
                  ↘
                    ↘ ↘ ↘

Waves curve around the island edges into the shadow zone.
```

The amount of diffraction depends on the ratio of **wavelength to obstacle size**:

- Long waves (swell) diffract more - they bend significantly around obstacles
- Short waves (chop) diffract less - sharper shadows

This is why bays can have gentle swell rolling in through an entrance while being sheltered from wind chop.

**Huygens' Principle**: Every point on a wavefront acts as a source of secondary wavelets. When waves pass an edge or through a gap, those wavelets spread out.

For a gap/inlet:

```
Swell direction: →

████████████         ████████████
            │       │
            │  Gap  │
            │       │
════════════╪═══════╪════════════
→ → → → → → │→ → → →│ → → → → → →
→ → → → → → │→ → → →│ → → → → → →
════════════╪═══════╪════════════
            │       │
            │       │  Waves spread out
            │   ↓   │  (diffract) through
            ╱   ↓   ╲  the gap
          ╱    ↓     ╲
        ╱   ↙  ↓  ↘   ╲
      ↙   ↙    ↓    ↘   ↘
```

The gap acts like a new wave source, radiating into the sheltered bay.

#### Refraction

Waves **bend toward shallower water** because the shallow portion of a wave slows down first.

```
Deep water                    Shallow water (near shore)

Wave crests:
                                   │
═══════════════════               │ Crests bend to align
    ══════════════════════       │ with depth contours
        ══════════════════════   │
            ══════════════════════│
                ══════════════════│
                    ══════════════│
                                  │ Shoreline
```

Effects:

- Waves tend to arrive roughly parallel to shorelines
- Headlands focus wave energy (waves converge)
- Bays spread wave energy (waves diverge)

Mathematically, wave speed in shallow water:

```
c = √(g × d)

where d = water depth, g = gravity
```

Snell's Law applies - waves bend toward the slower medium (shallower water).

#### Shoaling

As waves enter shallower water, they undergo **shoaling**:

- Wavelength decreases (crests bunch up)
- Wave speed decreases
- Wave height INCREASES (energy conserved in smaller volume)
- Waves become steeper

This is why waves get bigger and steeper as they approach shore.

**Green's Law** (approximate):

```
H₂/H₁ = (d₁/d₂)^(1/4)

where H = wave height, d = water depth
```

As depth halves, wave height increases by ~19%.

#### Damping / Dissipation

Wave energy is lost through:

- Bottom friction in shallow water
- Breaking (when waves get too steep)
- Turbulent dissipation

Near shores, waves are damped. Very shallow areas have reduced wave activity.

#### Reflection

Steep shores, cliffs, and seawalls **reflect** waves back:

```
Incoming wave →                Reflected wave ←
═══════════════►   █████████   ◄═══════════════
                   █ Cliff █
═══════════════►   █████████   ◄═══════════════
```

This creates interference patterns - "clapotis" where incoming and reflected waves create standing wave patterns with:

- Nodes (minimal motion)
- Antinodes (doubled motion)

Reflectivity depends on shore steepness:

- Gradual sandy beach: low reflection, high absorption
- Vertical seawall: high reflection

### 2.4 Wave Breaking (Brief Note)

When wave steepness exceeds a threshold, waves break. This happens when:

```
H/λ > ~0.14  (deep water)
H/d > ~0.78  (shallow water, depth-limited)
```

Breaking creates:

- Surf zones near beaches
- White water
- Significant energy dissipation
- Turbulence

**For our initial implementation, we're not modeling breaking waves.** This could be added later as a visual/physics enhancement.

### 2.5 Combining Wind Waves and Swell

Real sea states combine multiple wave populations:

| Component       | Source          | Character                           |
| --------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Primary swell   | Distant storm   | Long, organized, from one direction |
| Secondary swell | Different storm | May arrive from different direction |
| Wind waves      | Local wind      | Short, chaotic, follows wind        |
| Residual chop   | Recent wind     | Decaying locally-generated waves    |

The sea surface is the superposition of all these.

**Cross-seas**: When swell and wind waves come from different directions, creates confused, uncomfortable conditions.

## Part 3: Wind-Wave Relationship

### 3.1 How Wind Generates Waves

Wind transfers energy to water through:

1. **Pressure fluctuations**: Turbulent eddies create pressure variation
2. **Shear stress**: Friction between moving air and water surface
3. **Form drag**: Wind pushes on existing wave faces

Energy transfer is most efficient when:

- Wind speed matches wave phase speed (resonance)
- Waves are young and steep

### 3.2 Wave Development Stages

As wind blows over water, waves develop through stages:

```
Stage           Description                     Appearance
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Ripples         Initial capillary waves         Cat's paws on surface
Young sea       Short, steep wind waves         Chaotic whitecaps
Developing      Waves growing, spectrum filling Building seas
Fully developed Equilibrium with wind           Maximum wave heights
Decay/Swell     Wind stops, waves organize      Long, gentle rollers
```

Time to full development:

- 10 knot wind: ~10 hours, ~100 km fetch
- 20 knot wind: ~20 hours, ~300 km fetch
- 30 knot wind: ~30 hours, ~600 km fetch

### 3.3 Fetch-Limited vs Duration-Limited

**Fetch-limited**: Wind has blown far enough, but not enough fetch distance

- Common near upwind shores
- Smaller waves than wind speed would suggest

**Duration-limited**: Enough fetch, but wind hasn't blown long enough

- Common after wind shifts
- Waves still building

**Fully developed**: Both sufficient fetch and duration

- Maximum waves for that wind speed
- Open ocean in steady conditions

### 3.4 Implications for Gameplay

Different locations will have different wave character:

| Location                     | Fetch      | Expected Waves                             |
| ---------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Open ocean                   | Unlimited  | Fully developed - large, organized         |
| Lee shore (wind offshore)    | Short      | Small, choppy                              |
| Weather shore (wind onshore) | Long       | Large, can be confused near shore          |
| Narrow bay                   | Very short | Minimal wind waves, maybe diffracted swell |
| Channel                      | Medium     | Can be rough if wind aligned               |

## Part 4: Currents

### 4.1 Types of Currents

#### Tidal Currents

Driven by tidal water movement:

- Flow INTO enclosed areas as tide rises (flood)
- Flow OUT as tide falls (ebb)
- Strongest in constrictions (narrows, inlets)
- Reverse direction every ~6 hours

```
Rising tide (flood):

    ██████   ═══►   ██████
    ██████   ═══►   ██████
       Bay  ←═══   Ocean
    ██████   ═══►   ██████
    ██████   ═══►   ██████

Water flows INTO the bay through the inlet
```

#### Wind-Driven Currents

Surface water moves at ~2-3% of wind speed, angled ~15° to the right of wind (Northern Hemisphere) due to Coriolis and Ekman effects.

For coastal sailing, simplified as:

- Surface current roughly downwind
- Magnitude: windSpeed × 0.02-0.03

#### Gradient Currents

Water flows from areas of higher water level to lower. Near coasts:

- Wave setup near beaches creates offshore return flow
- Longshore currents parallel to beach

### 4.2 Current Effects on Waves

Currents modify wave behavior:

**Following current** (current in wave direction):

- Waves lengthen and flatten
- Reduced steepness

**Opposing current** (current against wave direction):

- Waves shorten and steepen
- Can cause breaking
- "Tide rips" where tidal currents oppose swell

**Cross current**:

- Waves bend (refraction)
- Direction shifts

### 4.3 Current Effects on Sailing

For boats:

- Speed Over Ground = Boat Speed + Current
- Apparent wind changes as current affects boat motion
- Tacking/gybing decisions influenced by current
- Strong currents through narrows can be dangerous or helpful

## Part 5: Summary - What to Simulate

### High Priority (Core Experience)

| Phenomenon                     | Why It Matters                               |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Wind blocking                  | Tactical use of wind shadows                 |
| Wind acceleration through gaps | Channel sailing dynamics                     |
| Swell blocking                 | Sheltered anchorages feel different          |
| Diffraction                    | Bays have character, not just "no waves"     |
| Fetch-limited wind waves       | Coastal areas feel different from open ocean |
| Basic shoaling                 | Waves change character near shore            |

### Medium Priority (Enhanced Realism)

| Phenomenon             | Why It Matters                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Wind turbulence in lee | Makes wind shadows feel realistic          |
| Refraction             | Waves align with shore, focus on headlands |
| Tidal currents         | Time-varying tactical element              |
| Wind-driven currents   | Affects boat speed calculations            |
| Damping near shore     | Shallow areas are calmer                   |

### Lower Priority (Future Enhancement)

| Phenomenon             | Why It Matters                   |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Reflection             | Interesting near seawalls/cliffs |
| Breaking waves         | Visual appeal, surf zones        |
| Cross-seas             | Weather transitions feel complex |
| Detailed wave spectrum | More realistic wave appearance   |

## Part 6: Simplifications We're Making

### Acceptable Simplifications

1. **2D propagation**: We ignore vertical wave orbital motion - just surface height and direction
2. **Steady-state terrain effects**: Pre-compute how terrain affects wind/waves, don't simulate fluid dynamics
3. **Linear superposition**: Just add wave components - ignore nonlinear wave-wave interaction
4. **Instant fetch response**: Wind waves adjust immediately to local fetch (skip duration-limited development)
5. **Simplified diffraction**: Approximate spreading rather than solving wave equation
6. **No wave breaking**: Waves don't break or dissipate in surf zones (for now)

### What We Preserve

1. **Distinct wind waves vs swell**: Different sources, different character
2. **Fetch dependence**: Local geography affects wind wave development
3. **Diffraction through gaps**: Key to making bays feel sheltered but alive
4. **Shoaling**: Waves change near shore
5. **Wind-terrain interaction**: Shadows, acceleration, turbulence
6. **Spatial variation**: No two places have identical wave/wind conditions
